# Machine Learning Research Journal

This is my personal journal to learn machine learning with the help of the pytorch library


### Entry 2023-09-06 
- Learned the basics of tensors and linear connection
- Created a very basic neural network ``personal.py``
- Personal environment allows the use of CUDA drivers (mileage may vary if you would like to test it on your machine) I suggest removing all references of CUDA if you don't have that compatibility
